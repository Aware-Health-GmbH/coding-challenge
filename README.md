# Coding Challenge

Dear candidate, your next step will be to demonstrate your skills in a small coding challenge.
The goal is to talk about your implementation and structure in the technical interview.

The challenge will take no longer than 2-4 hours.
There is no time constraint on finishing the challenge, you can take as much time as you need.
Please contact us if you run into any questions.

## Task

Please use the [GitHub Api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues#list-repository-issues) to fetch the current issues of the React framework:
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)

 - Fetch the issues and implement pagination if you see fit
 - The user is able to sort the issues based on `created`, `updated`, `comments`
 - The user is able to filter based on state `open`, `closed`, `all`
 - Please test your implementation if you see fit
 - Use React as a framework
 - **Nice to have**: use Redux as underlying architecture

Once you are finished, you can add a PR with your solution to this repository.

### Note
You do not have to share any sensitive data like your GitHub API key, you can adjust the README to your instructions, so we can run the app ourselves, for example by adding our API key.

## Good Luck
